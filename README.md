**This is an FYP project for SZABIST University (class of 2019) created by Idrees Darbar and Sheharyar Hassan.**

**‘SARS’**(Segmentation-Based Advanced Recommendation System) innovates personalized product suggestions by integrating advanced segmentation techniques. It analyzes buying power, psychological traits, and behavioral patterns for a holistic understanding of users. This depth enhances shopping, customer satisfaction, and engagement. Unlike typical systems relying on past purchases, SARS considers user interests, traits, and interactions. This inclusive approach ensures precise and fitting product recommendations, aligning with preferences. For businesses, SARS brings numerous advantages. Tailored suggestions heighten engagement, conversions, sales, and revenue. Data from SARS fuels targeted marketing, optimizing strategies and ROI. In the competitive e-commerce arena, personalized shopping sets businesses apart. SARS offers a leading recommendation system, attracting, retaining, and fostering customer loyalty.
